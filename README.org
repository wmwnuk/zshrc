#+title: My zsh dotfiles

That is configuration taken from [[https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/Machfiles][chris@machine]], heavily modified, but still.

This can be installed using stow. Just clone the repo somewhere and:

#+begin_src sh
stow /path/to/zshrc/ -t ~ zsh
#+end_src

*NOTE*: I don't intend on maintaining this repository, so that's a snapshot of
my zsh configuration frozen in time.

*** Dependencies
- Zoxide
- Fzf
- Nerd font

I might be missing something.
